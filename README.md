If you had $86400 in your account and someone stole $10 from you, would you be upset and throw all of the $86390 away in hopes of getting back at the person that took your $10? Or move on and live? You would move on and live. We all have 86400 seconds in each day. So why let someone's negative 10 seconds ruin the rest of the 86390. Don't sweat the small stuff, life is bigger than that.
